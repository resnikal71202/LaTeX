# Install
There are several components we need to use:
### A LaTeX distribution
Here we will use TeX Live. It is well maintained and is available on all common operating systems.
Install on [Linux/Unix](TeXLive/linuxunix.md), [windows](TeXLive/windows.md).
For [macOS](TeXLive/macOS.md) MacTeX is the way to go. It is essentially the same as TeX Live but with better compatibly for macOS.[^1]

### A text editor


### A bibliography manager (optionally)
My recommendation is [Zotero](bibliography/zotero.md) hence it is free and open source.
