# Install
There are several components we need to use:
### LaTeX distribution
Here we will use TeX Live. It is well maintained and is available on all common operating systems.
Install on [Linux/Unix](TeXLive/linuxunix.md), [windows](TeXLive/windows.md).

For macOS MacTeX is a great distribution. It is essentially the same as TeX Live but with better compatibly for macOS.[^1] We will use the instructions from the MacTeX webpage to install TeX Live on [macOS](TeXLive/macos.md).

### text editor
Personally I use [visual studio code](editor/vscode.md).

A huge List of different editors can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors).

### bibliography manager (optionally)
If you need to manage references, in your document, you can use a bibliography manager.

My recommendation is [Zotero](bibliography/zotero.md) hence it is free and open source.

Another option is [Citavi](https://www.citavi.com/).
